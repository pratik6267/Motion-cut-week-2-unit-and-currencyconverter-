[9:43 am, 04/10/2023] ~ Pratik Rokde:  Unit Converter
- Create a Python program that can convert between different units of measurement. You can choose one of the following options:
    - Temperature Converter: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
    - Length Converter: Convert between meters and feet.
    - Weight Converter: Convert between kilograms and pounds.

Project Requirements (Unit Converter):
- Prompt the user to enter a value and select the source and target units for conversion.
- Perform the conversion and display the result.
- Implement error handling to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, unsupported units).
- Ensure that your program provides clear instructions and user-friendly output.

Task 9: Currency Converter
- Build a currency conversion tool that allows users to convert between different currencies based on real-time exchange rates.

Project Requirements (Currency Converter):
- Fetch real-time exchange rate data from a trusted online source (e.g., using a currency exchange rate API).
- Prompt the user to enter an amount in one currency and select the target currency for conversion.
- Perform the currency conversion and display the result, including the exchange rate used.
- Implement error handling to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, unsupported currencies).
- Provide clear instructions for users to understand how to use the currency converter effectively.

Feel free to choose either the "Unit Converter" or "Currency Converter" project. Both projects offer unique challenges and opportunities for learning.

Example (Unit Converter - Temperature):
- User inputs: "Enter temperature in Celsius: 25"
- User selects: "Convert to Fahrenheit"
- Program outputs: "25°C is equal to 77°F."

Example (Currency Converter):
- User inputs: "Enter amount in USD: 50"
- User selects: "Convert to EUR"
- Program fetches the real-time exchange rate and outputs: "50 USD is equal to 42.67 EUR (Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 0.8534 EUR)."
